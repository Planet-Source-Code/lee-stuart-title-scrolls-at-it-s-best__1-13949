## Title Scrolls At It's Best


</div>

### Description

This is title scrolling at its simplest and best i suppose.

Well The Purpose of this code is for ppl who are just learning like me, and want something that they can understand.

Plenty of comments that are clear and make sense.

Plus a second project inside to make things a little harder, it lets you work out how it was done. This isn't mega-stuff, its really for just learners =) Anyways, enjoy.
