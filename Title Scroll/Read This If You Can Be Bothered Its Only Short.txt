Hey there =)
This is code for ppl who want to learn and are just learning, like me.
It shows you how to scroll the title rather simply on a form.
I have included some different scrolls you can use, In the folder "Try This After Title Scroll".
It is designed to make you think more as to how it was done after working with the actual Title Scroll Project.
There is lots of easy to understand commenting so anyone should know what they are doing.
I don't really bother about votes myself.
Like I said, this is for ppl to learnn from.
Anyways, I hope you enjoy it.
